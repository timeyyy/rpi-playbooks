# Usage

This is meant to be used with a Pi on [Hypriot](http://hypriot.com). Installing it with their tool, [flash](https://github.com/hypriot/flash), is pretty simple.

## On host

Add your SSH key to the pi (On OSX? You may need `brew install ssh-copy-id`):

```sh
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub pirate@ip.address
```

Here on, you can do the following remotely.

## Configure Pi

SSH into your pi.

```sh
sudo apt-get update && \
  sudo apt-get install python3.4-minimal python3.4 python-crypto python-markupsafe python-jinja2 python-paramiko python-pkg-resources python-setuptools python-pip python-yaml -y && \
  sudo pip install ansible
```

## Ansible

Run the specific role you want. Remember:

- Copy `pi.sample` to `pi` and edit the ip addresses. If you have multiple Pis you want to configure now, you may add them as extra lines
- In the following commands, replace `ip.address` with the Pi's ip address

First, we have to install the things it needs for the recipes to follow:

```sh
ansible-playbook setup.yml -i pi
```

## Playbooks

### TMUX

To install tmux with an opinionated `tmux.conf` (see `roles/tmux/files/tmux.conf`):

```sh
ansible-playbook tmux.yml -i pi
```

### Syncthing Backup Server

To make the Pi a Syncthing backup server:

```sh
ansible-playbook syncthing.yml -i pi --extra-vars="syncthing_username=admin syncthing_password=123456"
```

Visit port `8889` on your Pi to see the Web GUI.

### RVM & Ruby

```sh
ansible-playbook ruby.yml -i pi
```

### Wifi

You want wifi?

```sh
ansible-playbook wifi.yml -i pi --extra-vars="ssid_name=yourssid ssid_password=yourssidpassword"
```

### NoIP (no-ip.com)

**Hasn't been tested yet**

```sh
ansible-playbook noip.yml -i pi --extra-vars="noip_username=yourusername noip_password=yournoippassword"
```

### Disable SSH Password Login

Warning: make sure you are able to log in using a ssh key, or else you won't be able to log in remotely.

```sh
ansible-playbook secure.yml -i pi
```

### Samba share

Here we create a folder on `/media/storage`, with username `pi` with password specified below:

```sh
ansible-playbook nas.yml -i pi --extra-vars="dir=/media/storage/share smbpassword=yoursmbpassword"
```

### NFS (Server)

Copy `roles/nfs-server/files/exports.sample` to `roles/nfs-server/files/exports` and export what you want to be shared to the network.

```sh
ansible-playbook nfs-server.yml -i pi
```

### BitTorrent with Deluge

http://deluge-torrent.org

```sh
ansible-playbook bittorrent.yml -i pi --extra-vars="deluge_username=delugeusername deluge_password=delugepassword download_location=/media/storage/downloads/bittorrent"
```

In the specified download location, you should set the following in your deluge thin client:

- downloading
- completed
- watch
- torrent-backups

As shown in [this page's](http://www.howtogeek.com/142044/how-to-turn-a-raspberry-pi-into-an-always-on-bittorrent-box/) "Configuring Your Download Location" section.

## Watch Mount

```sh
ansible-playbook mount.yml -i pi --extra-vars="path=/media/storage"
```

If the mount cannot be detected, it will reboot the system. If you specify a dir that really does not exist, it will keep rebooting. You have 10 cycles (about ~150 seconds -- depends on what monit is configured consider a cycle) to change it before it reboots again.

# Others

## USB Auto Mount

It seems that using systemd to mount the USB caused me less boot issues. The old way of using autofs caused issues where the Pi would get stuck at boot.

See [this](http://serverfault.com/a/804212/63376) for instructions.

Find out where in `/dev/sd*` your disk is (probably `/dev/sda1`):

```sh
sudo fdisk -l
```

You should create the directory where you want it to be mounted: `sudo mkdir /media/storage`

You'll add something like this to `/etc/fstab`:

```
/dev/sda1 /media/storage auto noauto,x-systemd.automount 0 0
```

## Format disk

If you need format the drive, see [this](http://superuser.com/questions/643765/creating-ext4-partition-from-console).
